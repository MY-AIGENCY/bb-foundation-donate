# Biyombo Foundation Donate — Agent Context

## Standards

This repository follows the [Agent Development Standards](file:///Users/dontraub/agent-standards/STANDARDS.md) (v2.24.0).

> **MANDATORY**: All agents MUST read and acknowledge the standards before performing any work.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: Standalone donation landing page for the Biyombo Foundation
- **Type**: Static HTML site (single page)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (MY-AIGENCY/bb-foundation-donate)
- **Parent Project**: biyombofoundation.org

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | The complete donation page |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

## Important Constraints

> [!CAUTION]
> The "Donate Now" button is a **prototype placeholder**. Do NOT deploy with a real payment processor without explicit user approval.

1. All changes remain as drafts until user confirms
2. This is a static site — no server-side code
3. Payment integration requires separate approval and configuration
